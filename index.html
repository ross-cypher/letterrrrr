            <p>
            I hope you are doing well. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your presence and kindness.
            You've always been there for me, and I truly appreciate it. :D
            I've never been good at expressing how i feel, but when it comes to you, I find it easier.
            You have a way of making me feel comfortable and understood, even when I struggle to understand my own emotions.
            I cherish the moments we share, whether it's a simple conversation or a quiet moment together.
            I will always thank God for bringing you into my life.
            You have the most beautiful smile, and it lights up my day every time I see it.
            The way you laugh makes my heart melt and I can't help but smile when I hear it.
            I love the way you always know how to make me feel better, even on my worst days.
            Your soul is beautiful and kind, I love the way you care for others and how selfless you are.
            The way you know when something is wrong and how you always try to help me.
            I see how hard you work and how much you care about the people around you.
            I know you don't always see it, but you are an amazing person.
            I understand that you may not always feel like you are doing enough, but I want you to know that you are more than enough for me.
            You have a way of making me feel special and loved, even when I don't feel it myself.
            I love all of you, your quirks, your flaws, and everything that makes you who you are.
            You are perfect just the way you are, and I wouldn't change a thing about you.
            I want you to know that I am always here for you, just as you have been there for me.
            I know you don't talk much about your feelings, but I want you to know that it's okay.
            You don't have to hide anything from me, I will always be here to listen and support you.
            I want you to feel comfortable being yourself around me, and I hope you know that you can always count on me.
            I will always be here to support you, no matter what.
            I want you to know that you are never alone, and I will always be here to help you through anything.    
            You're doing great, and I want you to know that I am proud of you.
            I know that life can be tough sometimes, but I believe in you and your strength.
            I look forward to the next time we see each other and hope we can continue to make memories together.
            Thank you for being such an amazing person in my life. :3 I love you
